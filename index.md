### Remember the tic-tac-toe ?

![alt text](assets/img/tictactoe.jpg){:height="30%" width="30%"}

Get 3 of your marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) and you win.

### Strapion, the strategic tic-tac-toe

A Strapion board has nine grids, each composed of 9 cells. These are actually nine tic-tac-toe grids. Each grid won brings you 1 point.

During the first turn, the player who starts the game can play anywhere.

### Next grid rule

But from the second turn, a few rules apply.

The playable grid (blue) is defined by which cell has been played during the previous turn (red).

### Orange cell rule

It is forbidden to send your opponent to the previous grid. The forbidden cell, when applicable, will appear in orange.
